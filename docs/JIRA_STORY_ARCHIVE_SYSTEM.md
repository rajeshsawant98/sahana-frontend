# JIRA Story: Event Archive System Implementation

## Epic

**Frontend - Event Management Enhancement**

---

## Story Title

**Implement Robust Event Archive System with Admin Management**

## Story Type

🚀 **Feature**

## Priority

🔴 **High**

---

## Story Description

**As an** administrator  
**I want** to view and manage all archived events system-wide through a dedicated admin interface  
**So that** I can have complete visibility and control over archived events across the platform

**As a** regular user  
**I want** to archive my own events when they're no longer active  
**So that** I can organize my event history without permanently deleting events

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Admin Archive Management

- [ ] Admin can view a dedicated "Archived Events" tab in the Manage Events page

- [ ] Admin can view archive metadata (archived date, reason, archived by)
- [ ] Admin can navigate to archived event details
- [ ] Admin can bulk archive past events
- [ ] Archived events display shows proper pagination when needed

### ✅ User Archive Functionality  

- [ ] Users can archive their own events with a reason
- [ ] Users can unarchive their own events
- [ ] Users can view their archived events in a dedicated section
- [ ] Archive/unarchive actions provide clear feedback

### ✅ API Integration

- [ ] Frontend integrates with archive-related API endpoints
- [ ] Proper error handling for archive operations
- [ ] Correct handling of different API response structures
- [ ] Efficient pagination for large datasets

### ✅ UI/UX Requirements

- [ ] Clear visual distinction between active and archived events
- [ ] Intuitive tab-based navigation for admin users
- [ ] Proper loading states during archive operations
- [ ] Responsive design across different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### 🔧 **Components Modified/Created**

- `src/pages/admin/ManageEvents.tsx` - Added archived events tab with pagination
- `src/components/ArchiveEventButton.tsx` - Archive/unarchive functionality
- `src/components/ArchivedEventsView.tsx` - Display archived events
- `src/components/BulkArchiveButton.tsx` - Bulk archive past events
- `src/pages/MyEvents.tsx` - User archive management

### 🔧 **API Integration**

- `src/apis/eventsAPI.ts` - Archive-related API functions
  - `archiveEvent()` - Archive single event
  - `unarchiveEvent()` - Unarchive single event  
  - `fetchArchivedEvents()` - Get user's archived events
  - `fetchAllAdminArchivedEvents()` - Get all archived events (admin)
  - `bulkArchivePastEvents()` - Bulk archive past events

### 🔧 **State Management**

- `src/redux/slices/eventsSlice.ts` - Archive state management
- `src/hooks/useEventArchive.ts` - Archive operations hook

### 🔧 **Type Definitions**

- `src/types/Event.ts` - Added archive-related interfaces
  - `ArchiveEventResponse`
  - `ArchivedEventsResponse`
  - `BulkArchiveResponse`

## Dependencies

### 🔗 **Backend Dependencies**

- Archive API endpoints must be implemented
- Database schema updates for archive fields
- Admin permission checks for archive endpoints

### 🔗 **Frontend Dependencies**  

- Material-UI components for consistent styling
- Redux store for state management
- React Router for navigation

## Risks & Mitigation

### ⚠️ **Technical Risks**

1. **API Response Structure Variations**
   - *Risk*: Different endpoints returning different response formats
   - *Mitigation*: Flexible response handling with fallbacks

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - *Risk*: Slow loading with many archived events
   - *Mitigation*: Proper pagination and caching implementation

3. **State Management Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Complex state interactions between archive operations
   - *Mitigation*: Clear separation of concerns and dedicated hooks

### ⚠️ **UX Risks**

1. **User Confusion with Archive Actions**
   - *Risk*: Users accidentally archiving events
   - *Mitigation*: Clear confirmation dialogs and undo functionality

## Testing Strategy

### 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

#### Admin Archive Management

- Admin can view archived events tab
- Pagination works correctly for archived events  
- Bulk archive functionality works
- Archive metadata displays correctly
- Navigation between tabs maintains state

#### User Archive Operations

- User can archive own events with reason
- User can unarchive own events
- Archive confirmations work properly
- Error handling for failed operations
- Real-time UI updates after operations

#### Edge Cases

- Empty archived events list
- Network errors during operations
- Large datasets performance
- Concurrent archive operations
- Permission-based access control
